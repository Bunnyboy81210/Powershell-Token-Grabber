# PowerShell Token Grabber 

This tool is made for data exfiltration. All information collected is sent using discord webhooks.

# Usage

- Create a Webhook on your [Discord Server](https://discord.com). I recommend creating a new server.
- Replace YOUR_WEBHOOK_HERE in [line 6](https://github.com/Chainski/Powershell-Token-Grabber/blob/main/main.ps1#L6) with your webhook.



# Want to obfuscate the code ?
Use [Invoke-Obfuscation](https://github.com/danielbohannon/Invoke-Obfuscation). \
Or use [Somalifuscator](https://github.com/kdot227/somalifuscator) for .bat files
